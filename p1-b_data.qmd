# Data {#sec-data}

We usually use Panads for handling data that is organized in tables. Tables are two-dimensional. In other words, they have a length (number of rows) and a width (number of columns). Each row represents an observation and each of the values in a row represents some property describing the corresponding observation.

In the following table, we show some data which might stem from an online fitness platform. Each observation is a physical activity. In this example, each physical activity has an ID and is also described by the type of activity, duration, and the user who performed the activity.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-chapter-1-example-table
#| tbl-cap: Example table
import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "Activity ID": [1, 25, 39, 101, "…"],
        "User ID": [42, 22, 1, 42, "…"],
        "Activity Type": ["run", "hike", "bike", "run", "…"],
        "Duration in Minutes": [60, 210, 120, 45, "…"]
    },
    index=[0, 1, 2, 3, "…"]
)
```

Usually, datasets with only four records are not that interesting. The `…` entries are there to indicate that more data exist, however, we don't show them in most of the cases to keep the tables concise.

We will often use the activity data described in table @tbl-chapter-1-example-table. Can you think of tables with other data? 🙃 What would the rows and columns represent in your dataset?

You can find some examples in @sol-examples-for-data-in-tables.

## Outlook

In the following few chapters, we'll start as simple as possible, focusing on a single row or a single column of a table. Once we have a firm grasp of working with individual rows and columns, moving to tables will feel like a natural extension. So, first, we will learn how to

- represent a row or column in Pandas,
- perform calculations on the elements of a row or column,
- get and set specific elements of a row or column, and
- filter a row or column using simple as well as compound conditions.

<!-- TODO: mention here or (maybe even better) in the previous chapter that we will vizualize a lot of data as we go to make everything more intuitive -->

Sounds like a good start? Let's dive straight into our data analysis journey 😃
