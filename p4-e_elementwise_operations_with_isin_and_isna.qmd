# Elementwise Operations with `.isin()` and `isna()` {#sec-series-elementwise-operations-isin-isna}

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

## `.isin()`
<!-- ## [`.isin()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.isin.html) -->

Ready for a quality of life improvement? If so, let's first recall how we defined the `activities_series` variable.

```{python}
activities_series = pd.Series(
    ["run", "hike", "bike", "run"],
    name="Activity Type"
)

activities_series
```

Now, let's revisit @lst-series-combine-logical-or! There, we asked ourselves which activities involve running or hiking. We built the corresponding Boolean series by combining two other series using the logical OR operator (|). Imagine how the code would look like if we had ten activity types of interest instead of two. It would be very long and thus, unreadable! What if we could simply pass a list to Pandas containing the activity types we care about? This is exactly what we will do! In @lst-series-isin, we pass such a list to the `.isin()` method of our series.

```{python}
#| lst-label: lst-series-isin
#| lst-cap: Using the `.isin()` method to find which activities are either `\"run\"` or `\"hike\"`? 
activities_series.isin(["run", "hike"])
```

We get the same result as in @lst-series-combine-logical-or, but this time with less code 🎉️

What if we cared about all activities *but* running and hiking? We can use `.isin()` as before and invert the result using `~` as described in @sec-series-boolean-series-inversion-operator.

```{python}
~activities_series.isin(["run", "hike"])
```

Notice how we use `.isin()` in Pandas to replicate Python's `in` operator. Python's `not in` operator has no direct Pandas counterpart, however, we can replicate it using `~` in connection with `.isin()`.

::: {#exr-isin-operator}

Remember @exr-inequality-operation-with-two-series? There, the task was to create a series of thresholds for defining long activities. Running activities count as long if they last for at least 60 minutes, whereas hiking and biking activities require three hours to be considered long. Here is the series of activity durations.

```{python}
durations_series = pd.Series(
    [60, 210, 120, 45],
    name="Duration in Minutes"
)
durations_series
```

We have seen one solution to the task in @exr-logical-operators. Let's try to reuse the code from there and make it more concise using the `.isin()` method. To this end, we utilize the fact that both biking and hiking have the same threshold of 180 minutes.

```{python}
#| eval: false
(
    (durations_series >= 60) & (activities_series == "run") |
    # TODO
)
```

## `.isna()` {#sec-series-elementwise-operations-isna}

Recall from @sec-series-dtype-numeric that Pandas series can represent missing values. Missing values are often represented by NumPy's `nan` or Pandas' `NA`. Sometimes, Python's `None` is used for this purpose. If we want to count missing values or filter a series or table accordingly, we first need a Boolean series indicating which positions of a series contain missing values. For this, the `Series` class offers the `.isna()` method.

```{python}
#| lst-label: lst-series-isna
#| lst-cap: Using the `.isna()` method to find missing durations.
durations_series = pd.Series(
    [60, np.nan, pd.NA, None],
    name="Duration in Minutes"
)
durations_series.isna()
```

The `durations_series` in @lst-series-isna contains missing values – maybe because the corresponding activities are not finished yet. The `.isna()` method identifies all missing values – regardless of whether they are indicated by `np.nan`, `pd.NA`, or `None`.

::: {#exr-isna-notna-operators}

What if we are interested in values that are *not* missing? Can you construct a series where `True` corresponds to *existing* values in `durations_series`?

```{python}
#| eval: false
durations_series  # TODO
```

You can compare your solution to @sol-isna-notna-operators.
