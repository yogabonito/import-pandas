# Getting Elements Using a Boolean Series {#sec-series-indexing-boolean-series}

```{python}
import pandas as pd
```

<!-- 
```{python}
row_series = pd.Series(
    [1, 42, "run", 60],
    index=["Activity ID", "User ID", "Activity Type", "Activity Duration"]
)
```

Additionally, we will use a series representing the *User ID* column of @tbl-chapter-1-example-table.

```{python}
user_series = pd.Series(
    [42, 22, 1, 42],
    name="User ID"
)
```
-->

After our first steps with accessing parts of a series, we will now finally acquire filtering super powers. So far (@sec-series-get-elements-loc-labels), we have used `loc` with a single index label or a list or slice of index labels. However, we can also use a *Boolean array* instead. By Boolean array we mean a list whose elements are either `True` or `False`. (If you know the NumPy package, you can think of a NumPy array consisting of only `True` and `False` values as Boolean array, too.) If we index a series using a Boolean array, we only keep those series elements which correspond to the `True` values in the Boolean array. For instance, to get the first two elements of a series, we can use a Boolean array with `True` in the first two positions and `False` in the remaining positions.

```{python}
durations_series = pd.Series(
    [60, 210, 120, 45],
    name="Duration in Minutes"
)

durations_series.loc[
    [True, True, False, False]
]
```

Why is this so powerful? Because we can also use a Boolean series instead of a Boolean array! It's great that we already know many different ways to translate conditions and checks on our data into Boolean series (see chapters [-@sec-series-elementwise-operations-relational], [-@sec-series-elementwise-operations-logical], and [-@sec-series-elementwise-operations-isin-isna]).

Let's apply this knowledge using our `activities_series` variable.

```{python}
activities_series = pd.Series(
    ["run", "hike", "bike", "run"],
    name="Activity Type"
)
```

In @lst-series-equality, we have generated a Boolean series that indicates which activities involve running. Let's use this Boolean series to obtain only the running activities of `activities_series`.

```{python}
#| lst-label: lst-series-loc-Boolean-series
#| lst-cap: Filtering for running activities in `activities_series`.
activities_series.loc[
    activities_series == "run"
]
```

The index labels of this result indicate that the elements with labels `1` and `2` have been filtered out.

## Exercise Time

::: {#exr-series-loc-with-Boolean-series-1-same-series}

For this exercise, let's take a look at the `durations_series` variable again. Generate a series which contains only those elements of `durations_series` which are greater than or equal to 60 minutes.

```{python}
#| eval: false
durations_series  # TODO
```

::: {#exr-series-loc-with-Boolean-series-2-different-series}

In the previous exercise and in @lst-series-loc-Boolean-series, we used the series we wanted to filter in order to construct a Boolean series for filtering. However, it is also possible to construct a Boolean series from one series and to use it for filtering a different series. Let's assume that the durations in `durations_series` correspond to the activities in `activities_series`. Let's generate a series which consists of activities which lasted for longer than 60 minutes!

```{python}
#| eval: false
  # TODO
```

You can compare your solution to @sol-series-loc-with-Boolean-series-2-different-series.
:::

::: {#exr-series-loc-with-Boolean-series-resulting-from-logical-and}
Let's make our filtering conditions more complex. Try to get a subseries of `activities_series` which only includes long activities. Long activities are running sessions lasting for at least 60 minutes and hiking and biking activities which lasted for three hours or longer.

```{python}
# TODO
```

You can compare your solution to @sol-series-loc-with-Boolean-series-resulting-from-logical-and.

Awesome! Now, we know how to use Boolean series to filter a series, applying even complex filtering conditions 🎉️ <!-- Now we have seen many ways to get specific elements of a `Series` object. Next, let's find out how to set them! --> <!-- TODO: comment in again the two previous sentences. -->
